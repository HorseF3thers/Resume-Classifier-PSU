# These files represent the "functionized" CNN and BERT implementations trained by the training team
# Both function files (CNN_for_comparison.py and BERT_for_comparison.py) are called in the comparison notebook (Comparison_CNN_BERT.ipynb) for data visualization
# Both function files are again called for the sweeping notebook (Sweeping_CNN_BERT.py) for multiple argument combination comparison
